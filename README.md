## Overview

This Frontend challenge was for me to build a countdown timer; a very beautiful and useful feature on many modern websites.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle
